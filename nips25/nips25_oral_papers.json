    "abstract": "Understanding the geometry of neural network loss landscapes is a central question in deep learning, with implications for generalization and optimization. A striking phenomenon is $\\textit{linear mode connectivity}$ (LMC), where independently trained models can be connected by low- or zero-barrier paths, despite appearing to lie in separate loss basins. However, this is often obscured by symmetries in parameter space—such as neuron permutations—which make functionally equivalent models appear dissimilar. Prior work has predominantly focused on neuron reordering through permutations, but such approaches are limited in scope and fail to capture the richer symmetries exhibited by modern architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that captures four symmetry classes—permutations, semi-permutations, orthogonal transformations, and general invertible maps—broadening the set of valid reparameterizations and subsuming many previous approaches as special cases. Crucially, this generalization enables, for the first time, the discovery of low- and zero-barrier linear interpolation paths between independently trained Vision Transformers and GPT-2 models. Furthermore, our framework extends beyond pairwise alignment, to multi-model and width-heterogeneous settings, enabling alignment across architectures of different sizes. These results reveal deeper structure in the loss landscape and underscore the importance of symmetry-aware analysis for understanding model space geometry.",

    "abstract": "Recent research on motion generation has shown significant progress in generating semantically aligned motion with singular semantics. However, when employing these models to create composite sequences containing multiple semantically generated motion clips, they often struggle to preserve the continuity of motion dynamics at the transition boundaries between clips, resulting in awkward transitions and abrupt artifacts. To address these challenges, we present Compositional Phase Diffusion, which leverages the Semantic Phase Diffusion Module (SPDM) and Transitional Phase Diffusion Module (TPDM) to progressively incorporate semantic guidance and phase details from adjacent motion clips into the diffusion process. Specifically, SPDM and TPDM operate within the latent motion frequency domain established by the pre-trained Action-Centric Motion Phase Autoencoder (ACT-PAE). This allows them to learn semantically important and transition-aware phase information from variable-length motion clips during training. Experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of our proposed framework in generating compositional motion sequences that align semantically with the input conditions, while preserving phase transitional continuity between preceding and succeeding motion clips. Additionally, motion inbetweening task is made possible by keeping the phase parameter of the input motion sequences fixed throughout the diffusion process, showcasing the potential for extending the proposed framework to accommodate various application scenarios.

While local explanations offer insights into individual predictions, global explanation methods—those that characterize an entire class—remain underdeveloped. Existing global explainers rely on motif discovery in small graphs, an approach that breaks down in large, real-world settings where subgraph repetition is rare, node attributes are high-dimensional, and predictions arise from complex structure-attribute interactions. We propose GnnXemplar, a novel global explainer inspired from Exemplar Theory from cognitive science. GnnXemplar identifies representative nodes in the GNN embedding space—exemplars—and explains predictions using natural language rules derived from their neighborhoods. Exemplar selection is framed as a coverage maximization problem over reverse $k$-nearest neighbors, for which we provide an efficient greedy approximation. To derive interpretable rules, we employ a self-refining prompt strategy using large language models (LLMs). Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that GnnXemplar significantly outperforms existing methods in fidelity, scalability, and human interpretability, as validated by a user study with 60 participants.",

    "abstract": "We sharply characterize the optimal first-order query complexity of agnostic active learning for all concept classes, and propose a new general active learning algorithm which achieves it. Remarkably, the optimal query complexity admits a leading term which is always strictly smaller than the sample complexity of passive supervised learning (by a factor proportional to the best-in-class error rate). This was not previously known to be possible in the agnostic setting. For comparison, in all previous general analyses, the leading term exhibits an additional factor, such as the disagreement coefficient or related complexity measure, and therefore only provides improvements over passive learning in restricted cases. The present work completely removes such factors from the leading term, implying that $\\textit{every}$ concept class benefits from active learning in the non-realizable case. The results established in this work resolve an important long-standing open question central to the past two decades of research on the theory of agnostic active learning.",

Our study addresses this gap by providing the first polynomial-time learnability results (specifically strong, agnostic PAC learning) for single-layer Transformers with linear attention.  We show that learning the optimal multi head linear attention can be recast as finding the optimal kernel predictor in a suitably defined RKHS.  Moving to generalization, we construct an algorithm that, given a dataset, checks in polynomial time whether the set of best fit multi head linear attention networks on this data all perform an identical computation--a powerful notion for out of distribution generalization.  We empirically validate our theoretical findings on several canonical tasks: learning random linear attention networks, key--value associations, and learning to execute finite automata. Our findings bridge a critical gap between theoretical expressivity and learnability of Transformer models.",

Our upper bound also improves the previous best known upper bound of $(2/3) \\cdot d$ from Ben-David et al. (1997). These results demonstrate a quadratic gap between transductive and standard online learning, thereby highlighting the benefit of advanced access to the unlabeled instance sequence.

We provide a comprehensive characterization of these robustness properties, including formal guarantees under reward and transition uncertainty, as well as settings where the method performs poorly. Much of our analysis contrasts state entropy with the widely used policy entropy regularization, highlighting their different benefits.

A key challenge is understanding the mechanisms that prevent their memorization of training data and allow generalization. In this work, we investigate the role of the training dynamics in the transition from generalization to memorization. Through extensive experiments and theoretical analysis, we identify two distinct timescales: an early time $\\tau_\\mathrm{gen}$ at which models begin to generate high-quality samples, and a later time $\\tau_\\mathrm{mem}$ beyond which memorization emerges. Crucially, we find that $\\tau_\\mathrm{mem}$ increases linearly with the training set size $n$, while $\\tau_\\mathrm{gen}$ remains constant. This creates a growing window of training times with $n$ where models generalize effectively, despite showing strong memorization if training continues beyond it. It is only when $n$ becomes larger than a model-dependent threshold that overfitting disappears at infinite training times.\nThese findings reveal a form of implicit dynamical regularization in the training dynamics, which allow to avoid memorization even in highly overparameterized settings. Our results are supported by numerical experiments with standard U-Net architectures on realistic and synthetic  datasets, and by a theoretical analysis using a tractable random features model studied in the high-dimensional limit.",

    "abstract": "Computational methods for learning to sample from the Boltzmann distribution—where the target distribution is known only up to an unnormalized energy function—have advanced significantly recently. Due to the lack of explicit target samples, however, prior diffusion-based methods, known as _diffusion samplers_, often require importance-weighted estimation or complicated learning processes. Both trade off scalability with extensive evaluations of the energy and model, thereby limiting their practical usage. In this work, we propose **Adjoint Schrödinger Bridge Sampler (ASBS)**, a new diffusion sampler that employs simple and scalable matching-based objectives yet without the need to estimate target samples during training. ASBS is grounded on a mathematical model—the Schrödinger Bridge—which enhances sampling efficiency via kinetic-optimal transportation. Through a new lens of stochastic optimal control theory, we demonstrate how SB-based diffusion samplers can be learned at scale via Adjoint Matching and prove convergence to the global solution. Notably, ASBS generalizes the recent Adjoint Sampling (Havens et al., 2025) to arbitrary source distributions by relaxing the so-called memoryless condition that largely restricts the design space. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ASBS on sampling from classical energy functions, amortized conformer generation, and molecular Boltzmann distributions.

However, such real-world scenarios are often extremely difficult, combinatorial in nature, and require complex coordination between multiple agents. This level of complexity can cause even state-of-the-art RL systems, trained until convergence, to hit a performance ceiling which they are unable to break out of with zero-shot inference. Meanwhile, many digital or simulation-based applications allow for an inference phase that utilises a specific time and compute budget to explore multiple attempts before outputting a final solution. In this work, we show that such an inference phase employed at execution time, and the choice of a corresponding inference strategy, are key to breaking the performance ceiling observed in complex multi-agent RL problems. Our main result is striking: we can obtain up to a 126% and, on average, a 45% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art across 17 tasks, using only a couple seconds of extra wall-clock time during execution. We also demonstrate promising compute scaling properties, supported by over 60k experiments, making it the largest study on inference strategies for complex RL to date.

    "abstract": "We study the online calibration of multi-dimensional forecasts over an arbitrary convex set $\\mathcal{P} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ relative to an arbitrary norm $\\Vert\\cdot\\Vert$. We connect this with the problem of external regret minimization for online linear optimization, showing that if it is possible to guarantee $O(\\sqrt{\\rho T})$ worst-case regret after $T$ rounds when actions are drawn from $\\mathcal{P}$ and losses are drawn from the dual $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert_*$ unit norm ball, then it is also possible to obtain $\\epsilon$-calibrated forecasts after $T = \\exp(O(\\rho /\\epsilon^2))$ rounds. When $\\mathcal{P}$ is the $d$-dimensional simplex and $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert$ is the $\\ell_1$-norm, the existence of $O(\\sqrt{T\\log d})$ algorithms for learning with experts implies that it is possible to obtain $\\epsilon$-calibrated forecasts after $T = \\exp(O(\\log{d}/\\epsilon^2)) = d^{O(1/\\epsilon^2)}$ rounds, recovering a recent result of Peng 2025.\n\nInterestingly, our algorithm obtains this guarantee without requiring access to any online linear optimization subroutine or knowledge of the optimal rate $\\rho$ -- in fact, our algorithm is identical for every setting of $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert$. Instead, we show that the optimal regularizer for the above OLO problem can be used to upper bound the above calibration error by a swap regret, which we then minimize by running the recent TreeSwap algorithm with Follow-The-Leader as a subroutine. The resulting algorithm is highly efficient and plays a distribution over simple averages of past observations in each round.\n\nFinally, we prove that any online calibration algorithm that guarantees $\\epsilon T$ $\\ell_1$-calibration error over the $d$-dimensional simplex requires $T \\geq \\exp(\\mathrm{poly}(1/\\epsilon))$ (assuming $d \\geq \\mathrm{poly}(1/\\epsilon)$). This strengthens the corresponding $d^{\\Omega(\\log{1/\\epsilon})}$ lower bound of Peng 2025, and shows that an exponential dependence on $1/\\epsilon$ is necessary.",

To gain deeper insights, several simplifications of Adam have been proposed, such as the signed gradient and signed momentum methods. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study — training over 1,500 language models across different data configurations and scales — comparing Adam to several known simplified variants. We find that signed momentum methods are faster than SGD, but consistently underperform relative to Adam, even after careful tuning of momentum, clipping setting and learning rates. However, our analysis reveals a compelling option that preserves near-optimal performance while allowing for new insightful reformulations: constraining the Adam momentum parameters to be equal, $\\beta_1=\\beta_2$. Beyond robust performance, this choice affords new theoretical insights, highlights the \"secret sauce\" on top of signed momentum, and grants a precise statistical interpretation: we show that Adam in this setting implements a natural online algorithm for estimating the mean and variance of gradients—one that arises from a mean-field Gaussian variational inference perspective.",

The FP criterion, based on an annealed version of the celebrated Franz-Parisi potential from statistical physics, was shown to be equivalent to low-degree polynomial (LDP) lower bounds for Gaussian additive models, thereby connecting two distinct approaches to understanding the computational hardness in statistical inference. \nIn this paper, we propose a refined FP criterion that aims to better capture the geometric ``overlap\" structure of statistical models. Our main result establishes that this optimized FP criterion is equivalent to Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds---another foundational framework in computational complexity of statistical inference.  Crucially, this equivalence holds under a mild, verifiable assumption satisfied by a broad class of statistical models, including Gaussian additive models, planted sparse models, as well as non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA), single-index (SI) models, and convex truncation detection settings. For instance, in the case of convex truncation tasks, the assumption is equivalent with the Gaussian correlation inequality (Royen, 2014) from convex geometry. In addition to the above, our equivalence not only unifies and simplifies the derivation of several known SQ lower bounds—such as for the NGCA model (Diakonikolas et al., 2017) and the SI model (Damian et al., 2024)—but also yields new SQ lower bounds of independent interest, including for the computational gaps in mixed sparse linear regression (Arpino et al., 2023) and convex truncation (De et al., 2023).",

    "abstract": "Label Smoothing (LS) is widely adopted to reduce overconfidence in neural network predictions and improve generalization. Despite these benefits, recent studies reveal two critical issues with LS. First, LS induces overconfidence in misclassified samples. Second, it compacts feature representations into overly tight clusters, diluting intra-class diversity, although the precise cause of this phenomenon remained elusive. In this paper, we analytically decompose the LS-induced loss, exposing two key terms: (i) a regularization term that dampens overconfidence only when the prediction is correct, and (ii) an error-amplification term that arises under misclassifications. This latter term compels the network to reinforce incorrect predictions with undue certainty, exacerbating representation collapse. To address these shortcomings, we propose Max Suppression (MaxSup), which applies uniform regularization to both correct and incorrect predictions by penalizing the top-1 logit rather than the ground-truth logit. Through extensive feature-space analyses, we show that MaxSup restores intra-class variation and sharpens inter-class boundaries. Experiments on large-scale image classification and multiple downstream tasks confirm that MaxSup is a more robust alternative to LS.Code and reproducibility scripts are available at https://github.com/ZhouYuxuanYX/Maximum-Suppression-Regularization.",

To address this gap, we study the emergence over training of sparse attention, a critical and frequently observed attention pattern in Transformers. By combining theoretical analysis of a toy model with empirical observations on small Transformers trained on a linear regression variant, we uncover the mechanics driving sparse attention emergence and reveal that emergence timing follows power laws based on task structure, architecture, and optimizer choice. We additionally find that repetition can greatly speed up emergence. Finally, we confirm these results on a well-studied in-context associative recall task. Our findings provide a simple, theoretically grounded framework for understanding how data distributions and model design influence the learning dynamics behind one form of emergence.",

On the one hand, we construct a degraded imaging model based on physical mechanisms, such as the Retinex theory and atmospheric scattering principle, to simulate composite degradations and provide a data foundation for addressing realistic degradations. On the other hand, we devise a prompt-modulated restoration and fusion network that dynamically enhances features according to degradation prompts, enabling adaptability to varying degradation levels. To support user-specific preferences in visual quality, a text encoder is incorporated to embed user-defined degradation types and levels as degradation prompts. Moreover, a spatial-frequency collaborative visual adapter is designed to autonomously perceive degradations from source images, thereby reducing complete reliance on user instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ControlFusion outperforms SOTA fusion methods in fusion quality and degradation handling, particularly under real-world and compound degradations.",

Our results reveal an intricate interplay between activation degrees and layer widths in achieving identifiability. As special cases, we show that architectures with non-increasing layer widths are generically identifiable under mild conditions, while encoder-decoder networks are identifiable when the decoder widths do not grow too rapidly compared to the activation degrees. Our proofs are constructive and center on a connection between deep PNNs and low-rank tensor decompositions, and Kruskal-type uniqueness theorems.

Progress, however, rests on the premise that benchmark scores are both accurate and reproducible. We demonstrate that the reproducibility of LLM performance is fragile: changing system configuration, such as evaluation batch size, GPU count, and GPU version, can introduce significant differences in the generated responses. \nThis issue is especially pronounced in reasoning models, where minor rounding differences in early tokens can cascade into divergent chains of thought, ultimately affecting accuracy. For instance, under bfloat16 precision with greedy decoding, a reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B can exhibit up to 9\\% variation in accuracy and 9,000 tokens difference in response length due to differences in GPU count, type, and evaluation batch size.\nWe trace the root cause of this variability to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic under limited numerical precision. \nThis work presents the first systematic investigation into how numerical precision affects reproducibility in LLM inference. Through carefully controlled experiments across various hardware, software, and precision settings, we quantify when and how model outputs diverge.\nOur analysis reveals that floating-point precision—while critical for reproducibility—is often neglected in evaluation practices.\nInspired by this, we develop a lightweight inference pipeline, dubbed LayerCast, that stores weights in 16-bit precision but performs all computations in FP32, balancing memory efficiency with numerical stability.

Unlike prior approaches that rely on single-modality FM evaluations, PRIMT employs a hierarchical neuro-symbolic fusion strategy, integrating the complementary strengths of vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) in evaluating robot behaviors for more reliable and comprehensive feedback. PRIMT also incorporates foresight trajectory generation to warm-start the trajectory buffer with bootstrapped samples, reducing early-stage query ambiguity, and hindsight trajectory augmentation for counterfactual reasoning with a causal auxiliary loss to improve credit assignment.

As we increase the number of features in the SAE, hierarchical features tend to split into finer features (“math” may split into “algebra”, “geometry”, etc.), a phenomenon referred to as feature splitting. However, we show that sparse decomposition and splitting of hierarchical features is not robust. Specifically, we show that seemingly monosemantic features fail to fire where they should, and instead get “absorbed” into their children features. We coin this phenomenon feature absorption, and show that it is caused by optimizing for sparsity in SAEs whenever the underlying features form a hierarchy. We introduce a metric to detect absorption in SAEs, and validate our findings empirically on hundreds of LLM SAEs. Our investigation suggests that varying SAE sizes or sparsity is insufficient to solve this issue. We discuss the implications of feature absorption in SAEs and some potential approaches to solve the fundamental theoretical issues before SAEs can be used for interpreting LLMs robustly and at scale.",

    "abstract": "As the economic and environmental costs of training and deploying large vision or language models increase dramatically, analog in-memory computing (AIMC) emerges as a promising energy-efficient solution. However, the training perspective, especially its training dynamic, is underexplored. In AIMC hardware, the trainable weights are represented by the conductance of resistive elements and updated using consecutive electrical pulses.  While the conductance changes by a constant in response to each pulse, in reality, the change is scaled by asymmetric and non-linear response functions, leading to a non-ideal training dynamic. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for gradient-based training on AIMC hardware with non-ideal response functions.  We demonstrate that asymmetric response functions negatively impact Analog SGD by imposing an implicit penalty on the objective. To overcome the issue, we propose residual learning algorithm, which provably converges exactly to a critical point by solving a bilevel optimization problem. We show that the proposed method can be extended to deal with other hardware imperfections like limited response granularity. As far as we know, it is the first paper to investigate the impact of a class of generic non-ideal response functions. The conclusion is supported by simulations validating our theoretical insights.",

More precisely, we consider signed graphs, where the edge signs indicate positive and negative interactions of node pairs, and our goal is to infer opinion intervals that are consistent with the edge signs.  We introduce an optimization problem that models this question, and we give strong hardness results and a polynomial-time approximation scheme by utilizing connections to interval graphs and the Correlation Clustering problem.  We further provide scalable heuristics and show that in experiments they yield more expressive solutions than Correlation Clustering baselines.

Although offline RL explicitly avoids environment interaction, prior methods frequently employ extensive, undocumented online evaluation for hyperparameter tuning, complicating method comparisons. Moreover, existing reference implementations differ significantly in boilerplate code, obscuring their core algorithmic contributions. We address these challenges by first introducing a rigorous taxonomy and a transparent evaluation protocol that explicitly quantifies online tuning budgets. To resolve opaque algorithmic design, we provide clean, minimalistic, single-file implementations of various model-free and model-based offline RL methods, significantly enhancing clarity and achieving substantial speed-ups. Leveraging these streamlined implementations, we propose Unifloral, a unified algorithm that encapsulates diverse prior approaches and enables development within a single, comprehensive hyperparameter space. Using Unifloral with our rigorous evaluation protocol, we develop two novel algorithms - TD3-AWR (model-free) and MoBRAC (model-based) - which substantially outperform established baselines.

This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast, captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\\| (A + E)_p - A_p \\|$, where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up to a factor of $\\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals, including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under diverse perturbation regimes.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks with short residual connections have demonstrated remarkable success across domains, but increasing depth often introduces computational redundancy without corresponding improvements in representation quality. We introduce Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs), an architectural variant where additive long feedforward connections from each layer to the output replace traditional short residual connections. By analyzing the distinct dynamics induced by this modification, we reveal a unique property we coin as *auto-compression*—the ability of a network to organically compress information during training with gradient descent, through architectural design alone. Through auto-compression, information is dynamically \"pushed\" into early layers during training, enhancing their representational quality and revealing potential redundancy in deeper ones. We theoretically show that this property emerges from layer-wise training patterns found only in ACNs, where layers are dynamically utilized during training based on task requirements. We also find that ACNs exhibit enhanced noise robustness compared to residual networks, superior performance in low-data settings, improved transfer learning capabilities, and  mitigate catastrophic forgetting suggesting that they learn representations that generalize better despite using fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate up to 18\\% reduction in catastrophic forgetting and 30-80\\% architectural compression while maintaining accuracy across vision transformers, MLP-mixers, and BERT architectures. These findings establish ACNs as a practical approach to developing efficient neural architectures that automatically adapt their computational footprint to task complexity, while learning robust representations suitable for noisy real-world tasks and continual learning scenarios.",

Inspired by our empirical observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this perspective, we propose Multimodal Low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text, visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2, Qwen2, Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further exploration.",

Our theoretical analysis dissects the dynamics of attention modules into two distinct stages. In the first stage, asymmetric weight perturbations from random initialization sustain non-degenerate gradient dynamics in parameter matrices, facilitating systematic escape from small initialization regimes. Subsequently, these matrices undergo condensation, progressively aligning toward the target orientation. In the second stage, the previously static key-query matrices actively participate in training, driving the normalized matrices toward asymptotic rank collapse.

LLaDA employs a forward data masking process and a reverse generation process, parameterized by a Transformer to predict masked tokens. It provides a principled generative approach for probabilistic inference by optimizing a likelihood lower bound. Across extensive benchmarks on general tasks, math, code, and so on, LLaDA demonstrates strong *scalability* and performs comparably to our self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in *in-context learning* and, after SFT, exhibits impressive *instruction-following* abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in a reversal poem completion task.

Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation addresses this issue by retrieving contextual knowledge from external databases, thereby enhancing MLLMs with expanded knowledge sources. \nHowever, existing MLLMs often fail to fully leverage the retrieved contextual knowledge for response generation. We examine representative MLLMs and identify two major causes, namely, attention bias toward different tokens and knowledge conflicts between parametric and contextual knowledge. To this end, we design Adaptive Logits Fusion and Attention Reallocation (ALFAR), a training-free and plug-and-play approach that improves MLLM responses by maximizing the utility of the retrieved knowledge. Specifically, ALFAR tackles the challenges from two perspectives. First, it alleviates attention bias by adaptively shifting attention from visual tokens to relevant context tokens according to query-context relevance. Second, it decouples and weights parametric and contextual knowledge at output logits, mitigating conflicts between the two types of knowledge. As a plug-and-play method, ALFAR achieves superior performance across diverse datasets without requiring additional training or external tools. Extensive experiments over multiple MLLMs and benchmarks show that ALFAR consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art by large margins.

    "abstract": "Text-3D Scene Retrieval (T3SR) aims to retrieve relevant scenes using linguistic queries. Although traditional T3SR methods have made significant progress in capturing fine-grained associations, they implicitly assume that query descriptions are information-complete. In practical deployments, however, limited by the capabilities of users and models, it is difficult or even impossible to directly obtain a perfect textual query suiting the entire scene and model, thereby leading to performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Interactive Text-3D Scene Retrieval Method (IDeal), which promotes the enhancement of the alignment between texts and 3D scenes through continuous interaction. To achieve this, we present an Interactive Retrieval Refinement framework (IRR), which employs a questioner to pose contextually relevant questions to an answerer in successive rounds that either promote detailed probing or encourage exploratory divergence within scenes. Upon the iterative responses received from the answerer, IRR adopts a retriever to perform both feature-level and semantic-level information fusion, facilitating scene-level interaction and understanding for more precise re-rankings. To bridge the domain gap between queries and interactive texts, we propose an Interaction Adaptation Tuning strategy (IAT). IAT mitigates the discriminability and diversity risks among augmented text features that approximate the interaction text domain, achieving contrastive domain adaptation for our retriever. Extensive experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of IDeal.",

To solve this issue, we deduce a concise JMMD based on the Representer theorem that avoids the tensor-product operator and obtains two essential findings. First, we reveal the uniformity of JMMD by proving that previous marginal, class conditional, and weighted class conditional probability distribution distances are three special cases of JMMD with different label reproducing kernels. Second, inspired by graph embedding, we observe that the similarity weights, which strengthen the intra-class compactness in the graph of Hilbert Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC), take opposite signs in the graph of JMMD, revealing why JMMD degrades the feature discrimination. This motivates us to propose a novel loss JMMD-HSIC by jointly considering JMMD and HSIC to promote discrimination of JMMD. Extensive experiments on several cross-domain datasets could demonstrate the validity of our revealed theoretical results and the effectiveness of our proposed JMMD-HSIC.",

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning-based pan-sharpening algorithms have achieved notable advancements over traditional methods. However, deep learning-based methods incur substantial computational overhead during inference, especially with large images. This excessive computational demand limits the applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios, particularly in the absence of dedicated computing devices such as GPUs and TPUs. To address these challenges, we propose Pan-LUT, a novel learnable look-up table (LUT) framework for pan-sharpening that strikes a balance between performance and computational efficiency for large remote sensing images. Our method makes it possible to process 15K$\\times$15K remote sensing images on a 24GB GPU. To finely control the spectral transformation, we devise the PAN-guided look-up table (PGLUT) for channel-wise spectral mapping. To effectively capture fine-grained spatial details, we introduce the spatial details look-up table (SDLUT). Furthermore, to adaptively aggregate channel information for generating high-resolution multispectral images, we design an adaptive output look-up table (AOLUT). Our model contains fewer than 700K parameters and processes a 9K$\\times$9K image in under 1 ms using one RTX 2080 Ti GPU, demonstrating significantly faster performance compared to other methods. Experiments reveal that Pan-LUT efficiently processes large remote sensing images in a lightweight manner, bridging the gap to real-world applications. Furthermore, our model surpasses SOTA methods in full-resolution scenes under real-world conditions, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency.",

Furthermore, we use our bounds to investigate the problem of data \"memorization\" raised in those works, and which asserts that there are learning problem instances for which any learning algorithm that has good prediction there exist distributions under which the algorithm must \"memorize'' a big fraction of the training dataset. We show that for every learning algorithm, there exists an auxiliary algorithm that does not memorize and which yields comparable generalization error for any data distribution. In part, this shows that memorization is not necessary for good generalization.",

Data attribution provides a principled way to trace model behavior back to training samples, yet existing methods assume fixed datasets, which is violated in online RL where each experience both updates the policy and shapes future data collection.\nIn this paper, we initiate the study of data attribution for online RL, focusing on the widely used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. We start by establishing a *local* attribution framework, interpreting model checkpoints with respect to the records in the recent training buffer. We design two target functions, capturing agent action and cumulative return respectively, and measure each record's contribution through gradient similarity between its training loss and these targets. We demonstrate the power of this framework through three concrete applications: diagnosis of learning, temporal analysis of behavior formation, and targeted intervention during training. Leveraging this framework, we further propose an algorithm, iterative influence-based filtering (IIF), for online RL training that iteratively performs experience filtering to refine policy updates. Across standard RL benchmarks (classic control, navigation, locomotion) to RLHF for large language models, IIF reduces sample complexity, speeds up training, and achieves higher returns. Together, these results open a new direction for making online RL more interpretable, efficient, and effective.",

This hypothesis seems at odds with evidence from large-scale neuronal recordings in mice showing that neuronal population activity is high-dimensional. To demonstrate that low-dimensional latent dynamics and high-dimensional activity can be two sides of the same coin, we present an analytically solvable recurrent neural network (RNN) model whose dynamics can be exactly reduced to a low-dimensional dynamical system, but generates an activity manifold that has a high linear embedding dimension. This raises the question: Do low-dimensional latents explain the high-dimensional activity observed in mouse visual cortex? Spectral theory tells us that the covariance eigenspectrum alone does not allow us to recover the dimensionality of the latents, which can be low or high, when neurons are nonlinear. To address this indeterminacy, we develop Neural Cross-Encoder (NCE), an interpretable, nonlinear latent variable modeling method for neuronal recordings, and find that high-dimensional neuronal responses to drifting gratings and spontaneous activity in visual cortex can be reduced to low-dimensional latents, while the responses to natural images cannot. We conclude that the high-dimensional activity measured in certain conditions, such as in the absence of a stimulus, is explained by low-dimensional latents that are nonlinearly processed by individual neurons.",

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained robotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling native temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a promising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to complex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear optimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training on sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited sequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging its warm-up period.\n\nWe address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient slope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning, we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much more pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead to a $\\times2.1$ improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to bootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment interactions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive slope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques, including Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most –200 points under the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical understanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training methodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic systems.",

Among various approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks. However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class-wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task knowledge in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task-aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model’s overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend LLMs to handle images, videos, and audio by incorporating feature extractors and projection modules. However, these additional components—combined with complex inference pipelines and heterogeneous workloads—introduce significant inference overhead. Therefore, efficiently serving MLLMs remains a major challenge. Current tightly coupled serving architectures struggle to distinguish between mixed request types or adapt parallelism strategies to different inference stages, leading to increased time-to-first-token (TTFT) and poor resource utilization. To address this, we introduce Elastic Multimodal Parallelism (EMP), a new serving paradigm that elastically adapts to resource heterogeneity across request types and inference stages. Building upon EMP, we develop ElasticMM, an MLLM serving system that (1) separates requests into independent modality groups with dynamic resource allocation via a modality-aware load balancer; (2) decouples inference stages and enables parallelism adjustment and adaptive scaling via elastic partition scheduling; and (3) improves inference efficiency through unified multimodal prefix caching and non-blocking encoding. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that ElasticMM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) serving systems, reducing TTFT by up to 4.2$\\times$ and achieving 3.2–4.5$\\times$ higher throughput while meeting service-level objectives (SLOs).",

Trained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains, we show that DRPO training boosts diagnostic performance by 43% in macro‑F1 on average across all visual domains as compared to other critic-free training methods like GRPO. Furthermore, with QoQ-Med trained on intensive segmentation data, it is able to highlight salient regions related to the diagnosis, with an IoU 10x higher than open models while reaching the performance of OpenAI o4-mini.

This calls for dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles,  with efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We propose \\emph{Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning} (RHEL), an algorithm which provably computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of non-dissipative, \\emph{Hamiltonian systems}. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three ``forward passes'' irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated by the potential to implement our algorithm in non-digital physical systems, we first \nintroduce RHEL in \\emph{continuous time} and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous adjoint state method.\nTo facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems trained by RHEL, we propose a \\emph{discrete-time} version of RHEL which is equivalent to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent modules which we call \\emph{Hamiltonian Recurrent Units} (HRUs). This setting allows us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to hierarchies of HRUs, which we call \\emph{Hamiltonian SSMs} (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with sequence length reaching $\\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the performance of BPTT across all models and tasks.

However, the origin of this neural scaling law, that loss decreases as a power law with model size, remains unclear. We propose that representation superposition, meaning that LLMs represent more features than they have dimensions, can be a key contributor to loss and cause neural scaling. Based on Anthropic's toy model, we use weight decay to control the degree of superposition, allowing us to systematically study how loss scales with model size. When superposition is weak, the loss follows a power law only if data feature frequencies are power-law distributed. In contrast, under strong superposition, the loss generically scales inversely with model dimension across a broad class of frequency distributions, due to geometric overlaps between representation vectors. We confirmed that open-sourced LLMs operate in the strong superposition regime and have loss scaling inversely with model dimension, and that the Chinchilla scaling laws are also consistent with this behavior. Our results identify representation superposition as a central driver of neural scaling laws, providing insights into questions like when neural scaling laws can be improved and when they will break down.",

By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance on texture.

In this work, we propose a straightforward method called \\textit{\\textbf{R}epresentation \\textbf{E}ntanglement for \\textbf{G}eneration} (\\textbf{REG}), which entangles low-level image latents with a single high-level class token from pretrained foundation models for denoising. \nREG acquires the capability to produce coherent image-class pairs directly from pure noise, substantially improving both generation quality and training efficiency.\nThis is accomplished with negligible additional inference overhead, requiring only one single additional token for denoising (<0.5\\% increase in FLOPs and latency).\nThe inference process concurrently reconstructs both image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired semantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process.\nOn ImageNet 256$\\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence acceleration, achieving $\\textbf{63}\\times$ and $\\textbf{23}\\times$ faster training than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively. \nMore impressively, SiT-L/2 + REG trained for merely 400K iterations outperforms SiT-XL/2 + REPA trained for 4M iterations ($\\textbf{10}\\times$ longer).

    "abstract": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core task where embodied agents leverage their spatial mobility to navigate in 3D environments toward designated destinations based on natural language instructions. Recently, video-language large models (Video-VLMs) with strong generalization capabilities and rich commonsense knowledge have shown remarkable performance when applied to VLN tasks. However, these models still encounter the following challenges when applied to real-world 3D navigation: 1) Insufficient understanding of 3D geometry and spatial semantics; 2) Limited capacity for large-scale exploration and long-term environmental memory; 3) Poor adaptability to dynamic and changing environments.To address these limitations, we propose Dynam3D, a dynamic layered 3D representation model that leverages language-aligned, generalizable, and hierarchical 3D representations as visual input to train 3D-VLM in navigation action prediction. Given posed RGB-D images, our Dynam3D projects 2D CLIP features into 3D space and constructs multi-level 3D patch-instance-zone representations for 3D geometric and semantic understanding with a dynamic and layer-wise update strategy.  Our Dynam3D is capable of online encoding and localization of 3D instances, and dynamically updates them in changing environments to provide large-scale exploration and long-term memory capabilities for navigation. By leveraging large-scale 3D-language pretraining and task-specific adaptation, our Dynam3D sets new state-of-the-art performance on VLN benchmarks including R2R-CE, REVERIE-CE and NavRAG-CE under monocular settings. Furthermore, experiments for pre-exploration, lifelong memory, and real-world robot validate the effectiveness of practical deployment.",

    "abstract": "Equivariant neural networks are designed to respect symmetries through their architecture, boosting generalization and sample efficiency when those symmetries are present in the data distribution. Real-world data, however, often departs from perfect symmetry because of noise, structural variation, measurement bias, or other symmetry-breaking effects. Strictly equivariant models may struggle to fit the data, while unconstrained models lack a principled way to leverage partial symmetries. Even when the data is fully symmetric, enforcing equivariance can hurt training by limiting the model to a restricted region of the parameter space. Guided by homotopy principles, where an optimization problem is solved by gradually transforming a simpler problem into a complex one, we introduce Adaptive Constrained Equivariance (ACE), a constrained optimization approach that starts with a flexible, non-equivariant model and gradually reduces its deviation from equivariance. This gradual tightening smooths training early on and settles the model at a data-driven equilibrium, balancing between equivariance and non-equivariance. Across multiple architectures and tasks, our method consistently improves performance metrics, sample efficiency, and robustness to input perturbations compared with strictly equivariant models and heuristic equivariance relaxations.",

However, pretrained vision-language models often struggle to capture these nuanced dynamics and their temporal context, and specialized object state recognition frameworks may not generalize to unseen actions or objects. We introduce SAGE (State-Action Graph Embeddings), a novel framework that offers a unified model of physical state transitions by decomposing states into fine-grained, language-described visual concepts that are sharable across different objects and actions. SAGE initially leverages Large Language Models to construct a State-Action Graph, which is then multimodally refined using Vision-Language Models. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms baselines, generalizes effectively to unseen objects and actions in open-world settings. SAGE improves the prior state-of-the-art by as much as 14.6% on novel state recognition with less than 5% of its inference time.",

They typically require extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as \\blg, which can optimize visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic space. \\alg employs learnable matrices with M\\\"{o}bius multiplication operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that \\alg consistently improves both existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\\% additional parameters.",

We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio. SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of carefully curated question–answer pairs probing both directional and distance relationships involving static and moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages: (i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.",

However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation.\nInspired by how new software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present *grafting*, a simple approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants. Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38–2.64 vs. 2.27 for DiT-XL/2)\nusing $<2$% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model (PixArt-$\\Sigma$), achieving a 1.43$\\times$ speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via grafting. This reduces model depth by 2$\\times$ and yields better quality (FID: 2.77) than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging from operator replacement to architecture restructuring.

We discuss how to instantiate the algorithms for deep learning, which we dub Clipped Scion, and demonstrate their properties on image classification and language modeling.

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning (MML) is significantly constrained by modality imbalance, leading to suboptimal performance in practice. While existing approaches primarily focus on balancing the learning of different modalities to address this issue, they fundamentally overlook the inherent disproportion in model classification ability, which serves as the primary cause of this phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal learning approach to dynamically balance the classification ability of weak and strong modalities by incorporating the principle of boosting. Concretely, we first propose a sustained boosting algorithm in multimodal learning by simultaneously optimizing the classification and residual errors. Subsequently, we introduce an adaptive classifier assignment strategy to dynamically facilitate the classification performance of the weak modality. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the convergence property of the cross-modal gap function, ensuring the effectiveness of the proposed boosting scheme. To this end, the classification ability of strong and weak modalities is expected to be balanced, thereby mitigating the imbalance issue. Empirical experiments on widely used datasets reveal the superiority of our method through comparison with various state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal learning baselines.

    "abstract": "Vehicle GPS trajectories provide valuable movement information that supports various downstream tasks and applications. A desirable trajectory learning model should be able to transfer across regions and tasks without retraining, avoiding the need to maintain multiple specialized models and subpar performance with limited training data. However, each region has its unique spatial features and contexts, which are reflected in vehicle movement patterns and are difficult to generalize. Additionally, transferring across different tasks faces technical challenges due to the varying input-output structures required for each task. Existing efforts towards transferability primarily involve learning embedding vectors for trajectories, which perform poorly in region transfer and require retraining of prediction modules for task transfer.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose $\\textit{TransferTraj}$, a vehicle GPS trajectory learning model that excels in both region and task transferability. For region transferability, we introduce RTTE as the main learnable module within TransferTraj. It integrates spatial, temporal, POI, and road network modalities of trajectories to effectively manage variations in spatial context distribution across regions. It also introduces a TRIE module for incorporating relative information of spatial features and a spatial context MoE module for handling movement patterns in diverse contexts. For task transferability, we propose a task-transferable input-output scheme that unifies the input-output structure of different tasks into the masking and recovery of modalities and trajectory points. This approach allows TransferTraj to be pre-trained once and transferred to different tasks without retraining. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world vehicle trajectory datasets under various transfer settings, including task transfer, zero-shot region transfer, and few-shot region transfer. Experimental results demonstrate that TransferTraj significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different scenarios, validating its effectiveness in region and task transfer.

    "abstract": "Physics sensing plays a central role in many scientific and engineering domains, which inherently involves two coupled tasks: reconstructing dense physical fields from sparse observations and optimizing scattered sensor placements to observe maximum information. While deep learning has made rapid advances in sparse-data reconstruction, existing methods generally omit optimization of sensor placements, leaving the mutual enhancement between reconstruction and placement on the shelf. To change this suboptimal practice, we propose PhySense, a synergistic two-stage framework that learns to jointly reconstruct physical fields and to optimize sensor placements, both aiming for accurate physics sensing. The first stage involves a flow-based generative model enhanced by cross-attention to adaptively fuse sparse observations. Leveraging the reconstruction feedback, the second stage performs sensor placement via projected gradient descent to satisfy spatial constraints. We further prove that the learning objectives of the two stages are consistent with classical variance-minimization principles, providing theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks, especially a 3D geometry dataset, indicate PhySense achieves state-of-the-art physics sensing accuracy and discovers informative sensor placements previously unconsidered.

Through extensive experiments, InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench, outperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing diffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model generates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10$\\times$ faster than leading diffusion-based methods.

(2023, 2024) have deepened the theoretical understanding of the *Stochastic Gradient Bandit* (SGB) policy, showing that using a constant learning rate guarantees asymptotic convergence to the optimal policy, and that sufficiently *small* learning rates can yield logarithmic regret. However, whether logarithmic regret holds beyond small learning rates remains unclear. In this work, we take a step towards characterizing the regret *regimes* of SGB as a function of its learning rate. For two--armed bandits, we identify a sharp threshold, scaling with the sub-optimality gap $\\Delta$, below which SGB achieves *logarithmic* regret on all instances, and above which it can incur *polynomial* regret on some instances. \nThis result highlights the necessity of knowing (or estimating) $\\Delta$ to ensure logarithmic regret with a constant learning rate.\nFor general $K$-armed bandits, we further show the learning rate must scale inversely with $K$ to avoid polynomial regret. We introduce novel techniques to derive regret upper bounds for SGB, laying the groundwork for future advances in the theory of gradient-based bandit algorithms.",

There is only one caveat: these embeddings are hidden within the intermediate layers of the network. To draw them out, we introduce two alignment methods: language alignment for multimodal language modeling, and spatial alignment for dense prediction. Together, our PE family of models achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of tasks, including zero-shot image and video classification and retrieval; document, image, and video Q&A; and spatial tasks such as detection, tracking, and depth estimation.

PlayerOne is trained in a coarse-to-fine pipeline that first performs pretraining on large-scale egocentric text-video pairs for coarse-level egocentric understanding, followed by finetuning on synchronous motion-video data extracted from egocentric-exocentric video datasets with our automatic construction pipeline. Besides, considering the varying importance of different components, we design a part-disentangled motion injection scheme, enabling precise control of part-level movements. In addition, we devise a joint reconstruction framework that progressively models both the 4D scene and video frames, ensuring scene consistency in the long-form video generation. Experimental results demonstrate its great generalization ability in precise control of varying human movements and world-consistent modeling of diverse scenarios. It marks the first endeavor into egocentric real-world simulation and can pave the way for the community to delve into fresh frontiers of world modeling and its diverse applications.",
